easyNav Machine Learning Analyzer
==================================

## What is it?

Hyperparameter optimizer for easyNav.

This is necessary during training phase, to ensure better prediction results when deployed.


## Training

For effective testing, set 0.1 - 0.2 of data for test cases, and use the rest for training.  Do set an appropriate random parameter relative to test data size!


## KNN

KNN optimizes for the `K` parameter.


## SVM Hyperparameter Optimization 

Uses cross-validation method (and iteration) to generate best parameters.
